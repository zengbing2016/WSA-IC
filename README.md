# WSA-IC
Advantages: 1) WSA-IC removes the need of specifying optimal niching parameter for different problems, which increases the practicality; 2) WSA-IC can efficiently identify and jump out of the located extreme points during the iterations, so as to locate as more global optima as possible in a single run, which further increases the practicality; 3) The algorithm dependent parameters of WSA-IC are easy to set for different problems, which also increases the practicality; 4) The population size of WSA-IC does not have to match the number of optima of the optimization problem. Generally, WSA-IC can keep a relative small population size, which contributes significantly to reducing the computation complexity.
